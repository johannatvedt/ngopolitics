        <h2>Marwan Barghouti's health in serious decline: NGO</h2>
        <img src="Marwan Barghouti.jpg" alt="Picture of Marwan Barghouti">
          <p>An Israeli Prison Service spokesman denied that a decline in his health condition had been observed.</p>

          <p>The Palestinian Committee of Prisoners' Affairs released a statement on Monday saying that Israeli Prison Service officials had forcibly moved hunger-striking prisoners to different sections of Israeli jails, confiscated clothes and personal belongings and placed leading figures in solitary confinement.</p>

          <p>According to the NGO, Israeli authorities at the Jalame prison, where Barghouti was transferred and placed in solitary confinement after the strike began, have pressured him to accept medical treatment and urged other prisoners to try to convince him.</p>

          <p>Some 6,500 Palestinians are currently held by Israel for a range of offences and alleged crimes.</p>
